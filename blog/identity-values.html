    <body>My name is Anita, Iâ€™m from Bluff and have been living in Los Angeles for 4 years.

      Living in a place like LA makes you think massively about your values. Mine has never been monetary, its always been about creativity and freedom. To express myself and have the freedom to do so and be authentically who we are suppose to be and not what an image or idea makes us think we are suppose to have, follow or look like. My values are authenticity, strength without walls but with vulnerability and understanding. Which I greatly admire about New Zealand and our culture. If you have not lived out of New Zealand, please know how special we are.
      
      My identity, I am half Maori - Ngai Tahu, and half Dutch. A common mix here in NZ, but since I was brought up in NZ I identity with the Maori culture.
      
      I am attending Dev as technology is the way of the future, coding is an incredibly valuable and relevant skill to have that is only growing in the workspace. It also gives us location freedom which is very important to be able to design the lifestyle you want. One good thing about covid is that it has fast forwarded the idea of remote work.
      
      I am finding the work challenging and appreciate all the support available here. 
      
      Anita
