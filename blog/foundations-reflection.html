      What surprised me the most about learning core is that I talked myself down, instead of a default of up. Even tho I have done various studies in the past with no previous experience I was always able to learn the new skill but this seemed to be forgotten when I was put under stress. It was my first time learning remotely which i did not know what difficutlies that might involve including feeling alone in the learning process. I was suprised that there was no moments of feeling like it really clicked, it its a very gradual learning process that you find yourself just being able to slowly impliment.

    What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the core learning?    That i get frustrated way to easily, that I doubt my ability too much, that I compare myself too much.

    What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?       To know whats important and how to take care of yourself and others around you, be aware of attitude and recoginize triggers and reactions.


    What has surprised you the most about the core learning?  I'm surprised at how hard this is.



    What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?    Just learning how to use words/txt/punctionation in a way that we've been taught is wrong. 



    Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?   To technically and emotionally prepare students for the roles in the workforce. To be able to work in teams and for companies and have an enjoyable work life.

    Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer. I understand that self awareness and self care is such a huge part of your own happiness and therefore longevtiy with companies and in role so I think there is value greatly in that.
