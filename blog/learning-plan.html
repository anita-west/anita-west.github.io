    </head>
    <body>
      My long term goal is to be a digital nomad working a job I enjoy.
      My limitations concerning learning is I get frustrated with myself and worry about falling behind. I would like to build on not getting frustrated and enjoy the learning process and be ok with being on my own learning level. My workload commitment is to take a break when I feel overwhelmed, be well rested and be prepared. Be open with communication and not be worried about what others think.
      I’m commitment to seek help via the discord first at #tech-questions before moving on to #help-requests and utilising the co-working spaces.
      I expect the facilitation team to understand its scary to learn something so new and that some of us have been out of the ‘learning’ mindset for a number of years.
