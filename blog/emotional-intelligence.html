      EQ and IQ


What is EQ: being able to acknowledge ones own feelings, reactions,  and manage them and how to see, hear and understand others.

Difference between EQ and IQ: EQ is emotional, IQ is academic

EQ is important in helping us understand ourselves, be able to self regulate and listen and to be able to understand others and your affect on them. To be able to build relationships and reduce stress.
