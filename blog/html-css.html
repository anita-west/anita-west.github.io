    <p> What is the difference between Margin, Border, and Padding</p>
    <p>Margin, Border, and Padding are used to create space, balance and harmony, to let an element breath in a space and be viewed clearly and make sense to the viewer. Think of a set of framed and matted pictures. Each picture is surrounded by a mat that puts space between the picture and the frame. That space would be the padding. The frame encloses the mat and the picutre. That would be the border. Each picture has a set amount of space around the outside. That is the margin.</p>
