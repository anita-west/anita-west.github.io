     Java Script is the behaviour of elements containted on an html page. The way those elements look is CSS, when you interact with the elements, the things they do, is the Java Script action.

     Control flow is the selection of code that is run at a particular time, say when you start the car, first you get in the car, close the door, put your seat belt on, and turn the key, its the order things are done to make things work.
     Loops are code thats repeated over and over again until a desired result has occured, say you put shampoo in your hair, and you wash it, but it doesn't wash out, you'll continue to wash it until its washed out.

     The DOM is the representation - the family tree of all the elements that make up a web page. Data grouped together in a logical, hierarchical way.


     Functions execute a set of instructions on data and return the result.
